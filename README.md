# PasswordManager [for fun]
#### Deployed: https://passwordmanager1221.herokuapp.com/


#### Additional feature: Password encryption with the help of crypto npm pakage. The encryption and decryption done in the mongoose pre('save'), post('init') methods that tied to the model. The key for the encryption is the password of the user account (in text format). This password is not stored as a text in the database, therefor it is imposible wihout knowing actual user password to decrypt the logins and passwords that user has.     


#### CSS frameworks: Bulma
